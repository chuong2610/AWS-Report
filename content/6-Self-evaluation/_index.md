Throughout my 12-week internship at **AWS Cloud Clubs Vietnam** (from **September 8, 2025** to **December 8, 2025**), I experienced an engaging and in-depth learning journey in Amazon Web Services and cloud computing technologies. This was an excellent opportunity for me to transform theoretical knowledge from university lectures into practical skills in a real cloud computing environment.

**Main Activities I Accomplished:**

- **Workshop Development:** Designed and deployed a hands-on workshop on AWS S3 and VPC Endpoint, including writing detailed documentation (in both English and Vietnamese), creating lab environments, and testing practical steps.

- **AWS Services Research:** Deep-dived into core services such as S3, VPC, IAM, EC2, CloudFormation, and best practices for security and cloud architecture.

- **Event Participation:** Attended 4 large-scale AWS events in Ho Chi Minh City, learning about the latest trends in Generative AI, DevOps, IaC, Containers, and Cloud Security from AWS experts.


**Skills Significantly Improved:**

- Proficiency in designing and deploying cloud solutions using AWS Console and CLI
- Skills in writing standard, clear, and easy-to-follow technical documentation
- Deep understanding of cloud security architecture and networking
- Ability to translate and adapt technical terminology into Vietnamese
- Effective work in community environments and teamwork

**Work Ethic:**

I always demonstrated initiative and enthusiasm in every task. Not only completing assigned work but also seeking additional learning opportunities through events, webinars, and official AWS documentation. I also enthusiastically shared knowledge and supported other members in the AWS Cloud Clubs community, creating a positive collaborative environment.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
