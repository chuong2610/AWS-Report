> Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### **END OF INTERNSHIP EVALUATION**

**1. Working Environment**

The environment at FCJ is very open and professional. What impressed me most is the friendliness of the members; everyone is always willing to support each other at any time, even after working hours. The office space is neat and comfortable, helping me maintain high concentration.

*Small area for improvement:* I think the company should organize more social activities or regular team sessions to increase cohesion and help people understand each other better outside of work.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**

I highly appreciate the Mentor's guidance approach: extremely detailed but not "hand-holding." The mentor always encourages me to think independently and try solutions before providing suggestions, which helps me develop problem-solving abilities.

Additionally, the Admin team provides thorough support regarding processes and documentation, creating the most favorable conditions for me to focus on professional work.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**

The assigned tasks have a strong connection with the foundational knowledge I learned at school, while also expanding into many real-world technologies that the curriculum hasn't updated yet. This combination helps me both reinforce theory and quickly catch up with the practical requirements of businesses.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**

The internship was a major stepping stone in terms of skills. Professionally, I learned how to use project management tools and standard work processes. In terms of soft skills, I significantly improved my teamwork and professional communication abilities. Especially, the career path insights from the Mentor are valuable lessons that help me have clearer direction for the future.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**

The culture of mutual respect and support is a highlight here. Everyone works very seriously and focuses, but the atmosphere remains pleasant and not rigid. During peak periods (deadline rush), the "One Team" spirit is most evident: everyone supports each other wholeheartedly regardless of position or rank. I always feel respected and part of the collective even though I'm just an intern.

**6. Policies / Benefits for Interns**

The reasonable allowance support policy and flexible working hours are big advantages, helping students like me balance study and work. Additionally, being able to participate in internal training sessions is a very practical benefit.

### **ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS**

**What are you most satisfied with during your internship?**

It's the work mindset and dedication of the Mentor. I not only learned "what to do" but also "why to do it that way." The way the Mentor empowers me to handle issues myself has helped me grow much more compared to when I first started.

**What do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?**

As mentioned in section 1, I think the company should enhance internal connection activities (Teambuilding/Happy Hour) on a small scale so new interns can easily integrate and break down initial shyness barriers.

**If recommending to friends, would you advise them to intern here? Why?**

Absolutely yes. This is an ideal environment to transform textbook knowledge into practical capabilities. My friends will work in an open culture, be allowed to make mistakes and correct them, with the companionship of extremely dedicated Mentors.

### **PROPOSALS & EXPECTATIONS**

**Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**

I suggest the company could establish short "Sharing/Retrospective" sessions weekly or bi-weekly, where interns can share difficulties or interesting lessons they've just experienced with the whole team. This both increases interaction and helps everyone learn from each other faster.
