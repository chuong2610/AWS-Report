AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) This represents a fundamental shift in software development thinking:\nEvolution: Progressing from AI-Assisted (AI helps code) $\\rightarrow$ AI-Driven (AI leads) $\\rightarrow$ AI-Managed (AI manages operations) Implementation: Integrating AI across all phases: IaC (Infrastructure as Code), automated testing, to risk management 5. Amazon SageMaker – Unified Studio Consolidated environment for Data, Analytics, and AI with Lakehouse architecture support Comprehensive MLOps integration (Pipelines, Registry, Monitoring) accelerating GenAI application deployment III. LESSONS LEARNED \u0026amp; KEY INSIGHTS From the above content, I extracted three fundamental lessons for project development:\nDesign Thinking: Build Data \u0026amp; AI systems with \u0026ldquo;End-to-End\u0026rdquo; thinking from the start to avoid fragmentation Governance principles must align with self-service capabilities Technical Architecture: Maximize Zero-ETL usage (S3 $\\leftrightarrow$ Redshift/Aurora/DynamoDB integration) to minimize data pipeline overhead Utilize AI Agents for workflow automation rather than treating AI as just a chatbot tool Reliability and Accuracy: To reduce AI hallucinations, combine: Prompt Engineering + RAG + Fine-tuning Standard RAG workflow: $Input \\rightarrow Embedding \\rightarrow Context \\rightarrow LLM \\rightarrow Output$ IV. WORK APPLICATION PLAN Based on the acquired knowledge, I propose specific application directions:\n1. For Current Projects Features: Experiment with integrating AI Agents into Customer Support workflows and authentication processes Safety: Apply Bedrock Guardrails and validation layers to prevent AI from generating sensitive or misleading content 2. For Development Processes (Team \u0026amp; Learning) AI-DLC Model: Clear task division: AI handles code generation and documentation; humans focus on Review and Approval Infrastructure: Carefully evaluate Serverless (AWS Lambda) for short-lived tasks versus Containers (ECS/Fargate) for long-running/complex workloads 3. Personal Direction (Intern/Developer Role) Business-First: Always ask \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the business value?\u0026rdquo; before writing code or gathering requirements. Technology must serve business objectives Data Mindset: Recognize that a clean, structured data foundation is a prerequisite for effective GenAI performance Event Experience Attending the “GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization” workshop was extremely valuable, giving me a comprehensive view of modernizing applications and databases using advanced methods and tools. Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers Experts from AWS and major tech organizations shared best practices in modern application design. Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of applying DDD and Event-Driven Architecture to large projects. Hands-on technical exposure Participating in event storming sessions helped me visualize how to model business processes into domain events. Learned how to split microservices and define bounded contexts to manage large-system complexity. Understood trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication and integration patterns like pub/sub, point-to-point, streaming. Leveraging modern tools Explored Amazon Q Developer, an AI tool for SDLC support from planning to maintenance. Learned to automate code transformation and pilot serverless with AWS Lambda to improve productivity. Networking and discussions The workshop offered opportunities to exchange ideas with experts, peers, and business teams, enhancing the ubiquitous language between business and tech. Real-world examples reinforced the importance of the business-first approach rather than focusing solely on technology. Lessons learned Applying DDD and event-driven patterns reduces coupling while improving scalability and resilience. Modernization requires a phased approach with ROI measurement; rushing the process can be risky. AI tools like Amazon Q Developer can significantly boost productivity when integrated into the current workflow. Overall, the event not only provided technical knowledge but also helped me reshape my thinking about application design, system modernization, and cross-team collaboration.\n"},{"uri":"https://chuong2610.github.io/AWS-Report/","title":"Internship Report","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Internship Report Student Information: Full Name: Trần Ngọc Chương\nPhone Number: 0397812503\nEmail: chuongtnse181579@fpt.edu.vn\nUniversity: FPT University\nMajor: Software Engineer\nClass: SE181579\nInternship Company: Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd.\nInternship Position: FCJ Cloud Intern\nInternship Duration: From 09/08/2025 to 12/12/2025\nReport Content Worklog Proposal Events Participated Workshop Self-evaluation Sharing and Feedback "},{"uri":"https://chuong2610.github.io/AWS-Report/1-worklog/1.1-week1/","title":"Week 1 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 1 Objectives: Connect and get acquainted with members of First Cloud Journey.

Executive Summary The EV Station-based Rental System is developed to provide an all-in-one platform for electric vehicle rental and charging management. It integrates real-time rental, payment, and charging station access through a unified cloud-native solution. The system features a React Native mobile app and a Spring Boot backend deployed on AWS ECS Fargate, with PostgreSQL (RDS) and Redis (ElastiCache) for data and caching. User authentication is managed via Amazon Cognito, and global delivery is optimized using CloudFront. Designed under the AWS Well-Architected Framework, the platform ensures scalability, high availability, and security while maintaining cost efficiency.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? Current electric vehicle (EV) rental services are fragmented, requiring users to switch between multiple apps to locate, book, and manage rentals at fixed points. This creates inconvenience, slow performance, and unreliable experiences — users often arrive at “unavailable” or “offline” rental points, leading to frustration and loss of trust.\nFor vehicle owners and operators, manual fleet management, booking coordination, and maintenance tracking result in operational inefficiencies and lost revenue. Currently, there is no unified, real-time platform connecting renters, vehicle owners, and rental point operators.\nThe Solution The EV Station-based Rental System consolidates EV rental and return at fixed points into a single, cloud-native platform. Built with React Native for mobile and Spring Boot for backend, the system delivers real-time booking, vehicle tracking, and payment integration.\nKey AWS services include ECS Fargate for compute, RDS PostgreSQL for data storage, ElastiCache for low-latency performance, API Gateway and Cognito for secure access, and CloudFront for global content delivery. The platform supports both fleet-based and peer-to-peer (P2P) vehicle registration, providing a centralized interface for users and operators to manage rentals efficiently, securely, and at scale.\nBenefits and Return on Investment The platform eliminates manual coordination and fragmented applications, offering a unified, automated experience for renters and fleet owners. Real-time data ensures reliability and transparency regarding vehicle availability and rental point status.\nDesigned under the AWS Well-Architected Framework, the system minimizes operational costs with a serverless, pay-per-use model while maintaining scalability and 99.99% uptime. Within 1 months, the platform is projected to reach 1,000+ monthly active users, onboard 200+ rental points, and deliver significant time, cost, and operational efficiencies for both users and operators.\n3. Solution Architecture The VoltGo platform is built on a secure, scalable, and fully managed AWS serverless architecture. Backend services are deployed on Amazon ECS Fargate with container images stored in Amazon ECR. The system uses Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 for the main relational database and ElastiCache Serverless (Valkey/Redis) for low-latency caching and session management. All services operate within private subnets across multiple Availability Zones and are securely exposed through Amazon API Gateway integrated with Application Load Balancer via AWS PrivateLink. User authentication is handled by Amazon Cognito with JWT and MFA support. The frontend is hosted on Amazon S3 and delivered globally through Amazon CloudFront with AWS WAF and ACM SSL/TLS protection. AI-powered features are implemented using Amazon Bedrock integrated via AWS Lambda, while Amazon Location Service provides map and nearby station search functionality. Monitoring and logging are centralized in Amazon CloudWatch, and the entire infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform for automated and consistent deployments.\nAWS Services Used Amazon ECS Fargate: Serverless container orchestration for backend microservices. Amazon PostgreSQL: Relational database. Amazon ElastiCache Serverless (Valkey): In-memory caching for low-latency data access. Amazon API Gateway: Secure REST API entry point integrated via PrivateLink. Amazon Cognito: User authentication and authorization with JWT and MFA.

Core Objectives The event focused on revolutionizing software development and operations workflows on the Cloud platform:\nMindset Shift: Balancing feature release speed (Speed) and system stability (Stability) through DevOps culture and the Value Cycle. Infrastructure Modernization: Eliminating manual management risks (ClickOps) through Infrastructure as Code (IaC) methodology. Containerization Strategy: Providing a reference framework for selecting appropriate orchestration platforms: from simple (App Runner), specialized (ECS) to open standards (EKS). Deep Observability: Transitioning from passive monitoring to proactive system behavior analysis with CloudWatch and X-Ray. 2. Featured Speakers AWS Expert Team: Provided foundational knowledge and practical demo best practices. Trần Vĩ \u0026amp; Long Quy Nghiêm (FCJers 2024): Shared real-world experiences from the perspective of participants actively engaged in the First Cloud Journey program. 3. In-Depth Content 3.1. DevOps Mindset \u0026amp; CI/CD Pipeline: Foundation of Speed DevOps is not just a tool but a philosophy optimizing value flow:\nThe Value Cycle: Closed-loop process from Insight (Ideas) to Delivery (Handover). Redefining CI/CD: Continuous Integration (CI): Daily code commits, fail fast to detect errors early. Continuous Delivery: Automated deployment to Staging, but Production requires manual approval. Continuous Deployment: 100% automation to Production if all tests pass. Pipeline Principles: Build Once, Deploy Anywhere: Package source code once (Artifact) to ensure consistency across all environments. Measurement (DORA Metrics): Focus on 4 golden metrics: Deployment frequency, Lead time for changes, Change failure rate, and Mean time to recovery (MTTR). 3.2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC): From ClickOps to Code Mandatory shift from manual Console operations to Code-based management for Version Control and reusability:\nAWS CloudFormation: Native tool using YAML/JSON. Manages resources by Stack, clean deletion when removed. Terraform: Open-source (HCL), optimized for Multi-cloud. Plan -\u0026gt; Apply workflow allows previewing changes, safe for operations. AWS CDK: Uses modern programming languages (Python, Java\u0026hellip;) to build infrastructure. Supports Constructs (L1-L3) enabling complex system construction with just a few lines of code. Drift Detection: Critical feature detecting discrepancies between Code configuration and reality. 3.3. Containerization: Choosing the Right Platform There\u0026rsquo;s no best tool, only the most suitable tool for your needs:\nAmazon ECS: Simple, deeply integrated with AWS, for teams wanting to focus on Apps rather than Cluster management. Amazon EKS: International Kubernetes standard, for large systems requiring deep customization or Hybrid-cloud. AWS App Runner: \u0026ldquo;Zero-ops\u0026rdquo; solution, direct deployment from Code/Image to HTTPS URL without infrastructure concerns. Compute Options: EC2: Server management (High control, operational overhead). Fargate: Serverless for Containers (No OS management, just run Apps). 3.4. Observability: Beyond Monitoring Shifting from \u0026ldquo;Is the system alive?\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Why is the system slow?\u0026rdquo;:\nAmazon CloudWatch: Central hub collecting Metrics, Logs, and Alarms (Alerts/Auto-scaling). AWS X-Ray (Distributed Tracing): Solves the \u0026ldquo;black box\u0026rdquo; problem in Microservices by mapping request paths, pinpointing latency bottlenecks or error origins precisely. 4. Personal Lessons and Reflections This specialized session reshaped my thinking about the role of Cloud engineers:\nFrom Ops to Platform Engineering: The modern role isn\u0026rsquo;t about manual deployment chasing but building platforms (Platform Builders). The goal is creating safe CI/CD \u0026ldquo;highways\u0026rdquo; for Developer self-service. Operational Discipline: Stability comes from discipline. The Immutability principle and banning manual fixes (ClickOps) on Production are vital for smooth system operations, avoiding human errors. Tool Selection Thinking: Understanding each tool\u0026rsquo;s pros and cons (CloudFormation vs Terraform, ECS vs EKS) helps me make accurate architectural decisions, optimizing costs and resources for projects. 5. Conclusion The \u0026ldquo;DevOps \u0026amp; IaC Mastery\u0026rdquo; event equipped me with a comprehensive maturation roadmap:\nThinking: Systematize and measure with data. Tools: Control infrastructure with Code (IaC). Operations: Optimize with Containers and Observability. These are indispensable pieces for building and operating large-scale, sustainable systems on AWS.\n"},{"uri":"https://chuong2610.github.io/AWS-Report/3-eventparticipated/","title":"Events Participated","tags":[],"description":"","content":"During my internship, I participated in four AWS events.

Core Objectives The event focused on developing System Thinking, transforming participants from passive to active defense models with 4 pillars:\nDefense in Depth: Establishing multi-layered security (Identity - Network - Data), ensuring safety even when one defense layer is breached. Governance: Building a scalable, synchronized, and strictly compliant foundation for hundreds of accounts. Automated Response: Replacing manual handling with instant automated processes to minimize damage. Community: Connecting and spreading knowledge through the AWS Cloud Clubs network. 2. Featured Speakers AWS Cloud Clubs Captains: Student leaders from HCMUTE, SGU, PTIT, HUFLIT sharing development opportunities. Technical Experts \u0026amp; AWS Community Builders: Industry-leading specialists in: Identity \u0026amp; Governance Detection \u0026amp; Monitoring Network Security Data Protection Incident Response 3. In-Depth Content 3.1. AWS Cloud Clubs: Talent Launchpad Introduction to the development ecosystem for students and future Cloud professionals:\nVision: Environment for leadership practice and global connections. Benefits: Build Skills through real projects, Build Community, and Build Opportunities for career expansion. The Badging Journey: Gamified advancement path (Bronze -\u0026gt; Diamond), providing capability recognition and exclusive event participation rights. 3.2. Identity \u0026amp; Governance: First Line of Defense On Cloud, the boundary is no longer the Network, but Identity.\nCredential Spectrum: Shifting from Long-term Credentials (high-risk Access Keys) to Short-term Credentials (self-expiring STS tokens). Least Privilege: Minimum privilege principle, eliminating indiscriminate Admin permission habits. AWS Organizations \u0026amp; SCPs: Tiered accounts by function (Security, Shared, Workloads) to isolate risks. Service Control Policies (SCPs): System \u0026ldquo;constitution\u0026rdquo; creating hard guardrails that even child Root accounts cannot violate (e.g., prohibiting CloudTrail log deletion). 3.3. Visibility \u0026amp; Detection: Comprehensive Monitoring \u0026ldquo;You cannot protect what you cannot see.\u0026rdquo;\nAmazon GuardDuty: Scout using AI/ML to analyze logs (CloudTrail, VPC Flow, DNS). Runtime Monitoring feature detects malware or privilege escalation deep within the OS. AWS Security Hub: Command center managing security posture (CSPM). Automatically audits compliance (CIS, PCI-DSS) and standardizes all alerts to a common format (ASFF). 3.4. Network Security: Zero Trust Thinking Building a \u0026ldquo;Digital Fortress\u0026rdquo; with the principle of trusting no one, including insiders.\nVPC Fundamentals: Security Groups (Stateful): Apply Micro-segmentation using Reference IDs instead of hard IPs. NACLs (Stateless): Hard block untrusted IP/Subnet ranges. Advanced Filtering: DNS Firewall: Block connections to hacker command and control (C2) servers. AWS Network Firewall: Next-generation firewall with Deep Packet Inspection and integrated Suricata IPS rules. Architecture: Use Transit Gateway for centralized connectivity and automated firewall updates upon detecting malicious IPs. 3.5. Data Protection: Core Asset Protection Envelope Encryption: KMS\u0026rsquo;s optimal mechanism - Master Key encrypts Data Key, Data Key encrypts data to ensure performance. Secrets Management: Use AWS Secrets Manager to eliminate hardcoded passwords in code. Most critical feature is Automatic Rotation (periodic automatic password changes). AWS Nitro System: Specialized hardware encryption ensuring data security without performance degradation (Zero Performance Impact). 3.6. Incident Response: Speed is Survival When defense fails, response speed determines damage.\nPrevention: Security from Code (IaC) to eliminate human-caused configuration errors (ClickOps). 5-Step Process: Prepare -\u0026gt; Detect -\u0026gt; Isolate (Most Critical) -\u0026gt; Eradicate \u0026amp; Recover -\u0026gt; Post-Incident (RCA). Automation: Use EventBridge combined with Lambda to automate responses (e.g., auto-close publicly exposed S3 buckets immediately), because humans cannot outpace automated Hacker Tools. 4. Personal Lessons and Reflections This specialized series helped me distill critical principles for Cloud security:\nIdentity is the new boundary: Strict IAM management and using SCPs in AWS Organizations is more important than building network firewalls. This is the foundation of enterprise governance. Automation is mandatory, not optional: Facing automated attacks, manual handling is meaningless. The combination of GuardDuty, EventBridge, and Lambda creates an automatic immune system. Security starts from Code: Applying IaC helps control changes and prevent configuration errors from the start, realizing the philosophy \u0026ldquo;Prevention is better than cure.\u0026rdquo; 5. Conclusion AWS Cloud Mastery Series #3 provides a comprehensive handbook for building solid Cloud systems:\nFoundation: Identity \u0026amp; Governance. Alarm System: Network \u0026amp; Detection. Vault \u0026amp; Protection: Data \u0026amp; Response. These are the final pieces to complete the capability picture from Operations, Development to Security on the AWS platform.\n"},{"uri":"https://chuong2610.github.io/AWS-Report/1-worklog/1.4-week4/","title":"Week 4 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 4 Objectives: Automate system scalability with EC2 Auto Scaling Implement comprehensive monitoring with Amazon CloudWatch Master DNS management with Amazon Route 53 Optimize global content delivery with Amazon CloudFront and Lambda@Edge Learn command line automation with AWS CLI Understand advanced networking with VPC Peering Tasks to be carried out this week: Day Task Start Date Completion Date Reference Material 2 - Learn EC2 Auto Scaling - Practice: + Create Launch Templates with AMI, Instance Type, Security Group + Configure Auto Scaling Groups (Min=2, Max=4, Desired=2) + Set up Target Tracking Scaling Policy (CPU 50%) + Perform stress test to observe scale-out 09/29/2025 09/29/2025 https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/ 3 - Learn Amazon CloudWatch Monitoring - Practice: + Monitor standard metrics (CPU, Disk I/O, Network) + Install CloudWatch Agent for custom metrics (Memory) + Create Alarms with SNS notifications + Configure alarm for CPU \u0026gt;

This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:\nEND OF INTERNSHIP EVALUATION 1. Working Environment\nThe environment at FCJ is very open and professional. What impressed me most is the friendliness of the members; everyone is always willing to support each other at any time, even after working hours. The office space is neat and comfortable, helping me maintain high concentration.\nSmall area for improvement: I think the company should organize more social activities or regular team sessions to increase cohesion and help people understand each other better outside of work.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nI highly appreciate the Mentor\u0026rsquo;s guidance approach: extremely detailed but not \u0026ldquo;hand-holding.\u0026rdquo; The mentor always encourages me to think independently and try solutions before providing suggestions, which helps me develop problem-solving abilities.\nAdditionally, the Admin team provides thorough support regarding processes and documentation, creating the most favorable conditions for me to focus on professional work.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe assigned tasks have a strong connection with the foundational knowledge I learned at school, while also expanding into many real-world technologies that the curriculum hasn\u0026rsquo;t updated yet. This combination helps me both reinforce theory and quickly catch up with the practical requirements of businesses.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nThe internship was a major stepping stone in terms of skills. Professionally, I learned how to use project management tools and standard work processes. In terms of soft skills, I significantly improved my teamwork and professional communication abilities. Especially, the career path insights from the Mentor are valuable lessons that help me have clearer direction for the future.\n5. Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe culture of mutual respect and support is a highlight here. Everyone works very seriously and focuses, but the atmosphere remains pleasant and not rigid. During peak periods (deadline rush), the \u0026ldquo;One Team\u0026rdquo; spirit is most evident: everyone supports each other wholeheartedly regardless of position or rank. I always feel respected and part of the collective even though I\u0026rsquo;m just an intern.\n6. Policies / Benefits for Interns\nThe reasonable allowance support policy and flexible working hours are big advantages, helping students like me balance study and work. Additionally, being able to participate in internal training sessions is a very practical benefit.\nADDITIONAL QUESTIONS What are you most satisfied with during your internship?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the work mindset and dedication of the Mentor. I not only learned \u0026ldquo;what to do\u0026rdquo; but also \u0026ldquo;why to do it that way.\u0026rdquo; The way the Mentor empowers me to handle issues myself has helped me grow much more compared to when I first started.\nWhat do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?\nAs mentioned in section 1, I think the company should enhance internal connection activities (Teambuilding/Happy Hour) on a small scale so new interns can easily integrate and break down initial shyness barriers.\nIf recommending to friends, would you advise them to intern here? Why?\nAbsolutely yes. This is an ideal environment to transform textbook knowledge into practical capabilities. My friends will work in an open culture, be allowed to make mistakes and correct them, with the companionship of extremely dedicated Mentors.\nPROPOSALS \u0026amp; EXPECTATIONS Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?\nI suggest the company could establish short \u0026ldquo;Sharing/Retrospective\u0026rdquo; sessions weekly or bi-weekly, where interns can share difficulties or interesting lessons they\u0026rsquo;ve just experienced with the whole team. This both increases interaction and helps everyone learn from each other faster.\n"},{"uri":"https://chuong2610.github.io/AWS-Report/4-workshop/4.6-testing/","title":"Testing the System","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Testing the EV Rental AI Agent In this section, you will test all three core features of the AI Agent to ensure everything works correctly.\nPrerequisites for Testing Before testing, ensure:\n✅ Backend server running on http://localhost:8000 ✅ Frontend application running on http://localhost:3000 ✅ PostgreSQL database is running and populated with test data ✅ AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base is synced and ready Test Scenario 1: Knowledge Base Search The AI Agent should be able to answer questions about rental policies, pricing, and FAQs using the Knowledge Base.\nTest Queries:\nRental Policy:\nUser: \u0026#34;Chính sách thuê xe là gì?\u0026#34;

follow these steps to clean up all resources and avoid unnecessary AWS charges.\nWhy Cleanup is Important Cost Savings: AWS charges for active resources like Bedrock Knowledge Bases, S3 storage, and running services Security: Remove unused IAM credentials to maintain security best practices Organization: Keep your AWS account clean and organized Step 1: Delete AWS Bedrock Knowledge Base 1.1 Delete Knowledge Base Open the AWS Bedrock Console Navigate to Knowledge Bases in the left sidebar Select your Knowledge Base: ev-rental-knowledge-base Click Delete Confirm deletion by typing the Knowledge Base name Click Delete to confirm ⚠️ Note: This will also delete the associated data source connections.\n1.2 Delete S3 Bucket and Documents Open the S3 Console Find your bucket: ev-rental-knowledge-docs Select the bucket Click Empty to delete all objects Confirm by typing \u0026ldquo;permanently delete\u0026rdquo; After emptying, click Delete on the bucket Confirm by typing the bucket name Or use AWS CLI:\n# Delete all objects in bucket aws s3 rm s3://ev-rental-knowledge-docs --recursive # Delete the bucket aws s3 rb s3://ev-rental-knowledge-docs Step 2: Delete IAM User and Access Keys 2.1 Delete Access Keys Open the IAM Console Navigate to Users Select your user (e.g., bedrock-agent-user) Click on the Security credentials tab Under Access keys, find your access key Click Delete next to the access key Confirm deletion 2.2 Delete IAM User (Optional) If you created a dedicated IAM user for this workshop:\nIn the IAM Console, select the user Click Delete user Confirm by checking the box Click Delete Or use AWS CLI:\n# List access keys aws iam list-access-keys --user-name bedrock-agent-user # Delete access key (replace with your key ID) aws iam delete-access-key --user-name bedrock-agent-user --access-key-id AKIA5GPEMGJZK6E7PMEB # Delete user aws iam delete-user --user-name bedrock-agent-user Step 3: Stop Local Services 3.1 Stop FastAPI Backend In the terminal where FastAPI is running:\nPress Ctrl + C to stop the server\nDeactivate virtual environment:\ndeactivate Optionally delete the project folder:\n# On macOS/Linux rm -rf ev-rental-backend # On Windows rmdir /s ev-rental-backend 3.2 Stop React Frontend In the terminal where React is running:\nPress Ctrl + C to stop the development server\nOptionally delete the project folder:\n# On macOS/Linux rm -rf ev-rental-frontend # On Windows rmdir /s ev-rental-frontend 3.3 Stop PostgreSQL Database If you installed PostgreSQL locally for this workshop:\nOn macOS:\n# Stop PostgreSQL service brew services stop postgresql@14 On Linux:\nsudo systemctl stop postgresql On Windows:\n# Open Services (services.msc) # Find \u0026#34;PostgreSQL\u0026#34; service # Right-click → Stop 3.4 Delete Database (Optional) If you want to completely remove the database:\n# Connect to PostgreSQL psql -U postgres # Drop database DROP DATABASE ev_rental_db; # Exit \\q Step 4: Remove Environment Files Delete sensitive .env files that contain credentials:\nBackend:\ncd ev-rental-backend rm .env Frontend:\ncd ev-rental-frontend rm .env ⚠️ Security Note: Never commit .env files to
